## Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid problems with libraries and dependencies. It is also important to agree on a Python version.

For Linux and MacOS:

```bash
pip install virtualenv # if not installed
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
source venv/bin/activate
deactivate # to deactivate the virtual environment
```

For Windows:

```bash
pip install virtualenv # if not installed
virtualenv myenv # create a virtual environment in the current directory
myenv\Scripts\activate
deactivate # to deactivate the virtual environment
```

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add required libraries to requirements.txt:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
